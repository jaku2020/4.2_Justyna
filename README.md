This file contains findings about drivers that received coupons from Amazon. I have done a research on 

1. drivers that selected bar coupons and found that:
* Bar coupon was the 4th most used coupon.
* The proportion of bar coupons that were accepted was 56.84%.
* The acceptance rate for those who went to a bar 3 or fewer times a month was 56.16%.
* The acceptance rate for those who went to a bar more than 3 times a month was 62.25%.
* The acceptance rate between drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25 to the all others is 74.21%.
* The acceptance rate for drivers who go to bars more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry is 69.02%.
* The acceptance rate for drivers who go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 is 62.81%.
Recommendations:
* Do more detailed research,
* Concentrate marketing efforts on all above mentioned groups since their acceptance rate is over 50%, which is high ROI. Target groups with coupons specific to them.

2. drivers who had kids and accepted the coupons and found that the highest coupon acceptance rate is for following conditions (not necessarily clubbed together):
* the coupon wasn't in the same direction,
* they had no urgent place to go,
* they were driving alone,
* weather was sunny,
* temperature was 80,
* time was 6PM,
* coupons for restaurant(<20),
* coupons with 1d expiration,
* gender: female,
* age: 50+,
* maritalStatus: Married partner,
* education: Some college - no degree,
* income: 25000 - 37499,
* occupation: Computer and Mathematical,
* the most Bar coupons were accepted by drivers that never go to Bar,
* the most Coffee House coupons were accepted by drivers that go to Coffee House 1-3/month,
* the most CarryAway coupons were accepted by drivers that order food 4-8 times/month,
* the most inexpensive restaurant coupons were accepted by drivers that go there 1-3 times/month,
* the most expensive restaurant coupons were accepted by drivers that go there less than once a month.

All the above information is very obvious based on charts included in this file. More data digging can easily show a better story.
Some specific examples of drivers disclosed following:
* The acceptance rate for drivers who have kids and accepted coupon that wasn't in the same direction, had no urgent place to go and were driving alone compared to all drivers with kids is 5.52%.
* The acceptance rate for drivers who have kids, accepted coupon and had sunny weather compared to all drivers with kids is 45.25 %.
* The acceptance rate for drivers who have kids and accepted coupon at 6PM compared to all drivers with kids is 14.07 %.
* The acceptance rate for drivers who have kids and accepted restaurant(<20) coupon with 1d expiration compared to all drivers with kids is 8.62 %.
* The acceptance rate for drivers who are female, married, and have some college, kids and accepted coupon compared to all drivers with kids is 6.24%.
* The acceptance rate for drivers who have kids, never go to bars, and accepted the Bar coupon compared to all drivers with kids is 26.02%.
* The acceptance rate for drivers who have kids, go to Coffee house 1-3 times a month, and accepted the CoffeeHouse coupon compared to all drivers with kids is 15.9%.
* The acceptance rate for drivers who have kids, use CarryAway 4-8 times a month, and accepted the CarryAway coupon compared to all drivers with kids is 21.82%
* The acceptance rate for drivers who have kids, go to inexpensive restaurant 1-3 times a month, and accepted the RestaurantLessThan20 coupon compared to all drivers with kids is 26.08%
* The acceptance rate for drivers who have kids, go to expensive restaurant less than once a month, and accepted the Restaurant20to50 coupon compared to all drivers with kids is 26.40%

Next steps and recommendations:
Based on above findings Amazon can charge higher rates for specific demographics, times of day, location and weather. Marketing campaigns can be geared towards specific groups to increase the coupon acceptance rate. 3 groups that had a great ROI for family type were:
* The acceptance rate for drivers who have kids, go to expensive restaurant less than once a month, and accepted the Restaurant20to50 coupon compared to all drivers with kids is 26.40%
* The acceptance rate for drivers who have kids, go to inexpensive restaurant 1-3 times a month, and accepted the RestaurantLessThan20 coupon compared to all drivers with kids is 26.08%
* The acceptance rate for drivers who have kids, never go to bars, and accepted the Bar coupon compared to all drivers with kids is 26.02%.
